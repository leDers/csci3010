int main() {
    // 1) Instantiate a couple Books. Set their fields equal to some values.
    // Print out the values of the books' fields.


    // 2) Instantiate a Library.

    // 3) Add a void Donate(Book b) method to your Library class.
    // Your Library should store the new book at the end of its shelf.


    // 4) Donate one of the Books that you instantiated to your Library.


    // 5) Print out the books in the Library (use the given PrintBooks method)


    // 6) Change the title and/or author of the book that you donated to
    // something different.
    // Print out the new book information, then print out the books in your
    // Library. Did changing the Book information change it in your Library?
    //
    // Answer (and your hypothesis for why/why not):


    // 7) Create two Books that are separate structs (not pointers or references)
    // but that have the same information.
    // use the == operator to test if they are equal. What happens?
    // if it succeeds, are these equal?
    //
    // Answer:

    // 8) Create two Book references to your Books from # 7.
    // use the == operator to test if they are equal. What happens?
    // if it succeeds, are these equal?
    //
    // Answer:

    // 9) Create two Book pointers to your Books from # 7.
    // use the == operator to test if they are equal. What happens?
    // if it succeeds, are these equal?
    //
    // Answer:


    // 10) Add a void Donate(Book b, int num_copies) method to your Library class.
    // your Library should add num_copies of Book b to its shelf.


    // 11) Finally, if you reach this far, work on finding a solution to making it so
    // that you would be able to do any of the comparisons from # 7, 8, and 9
