############################## Python Interpreter Questions ##########################
# Explore these questions in a python interpreter from the command line
# Run the python interpreter by typing "python". Make sure that you are running python version 3
# You'll see something like "Python 3.6.1 |Anaconda 4.4.0 (x86_64)| (default, May 11 2017, 13:04:09)"
# When you start the interpreter.
# If you start it and the version is not 3.x.x, try running "python3".
#
# 1. how do you declare a variable? Give an example.
#       python has no command for declaring a variable, you can do so implicityly
#       ex. x = 1; list = [1,2,3]
#
# 2. How do you declare a variable of type int? float? string? boolean?
#       w = 1
#       x = 1.0
#       y = '1'
#       z = True
#
# 3. How do you declare a variable that is an empty list? a non-empty list?
#       empty = []
#       non-empty = [0,1]
#
# 4. How do you find the length of a string or a list in python?
#       length = len(s)
#
# 5. How do you print to standard out?
#       print(message)
#
# 6. What does whitespace (spaces, tabs) indicate in python?
#       white space indicates scope
#

# 1. run this file from the command line. What command did you use?
# Answer:

# Here is a function defined in python
def add_values(val1, val2):
    added = val1 + val2
    print(added)

# 2. Write at least 3 function calls to add_values using different types as parameters


def print_all_values(thing):
    for subthing in thing:
        print(subthing)


# 3. Write at least 2 function calls to print_all_values using different types as parameters


# 4. Modify the function below so that if any 2 (or 3) colors are within 10 of each other,
# it prints "Mixed!" instead.
def color_dominance(red, green, blue):
    dominant = max(red, green, blue)
    if dominant == red:
        print("Most red!")
    elif dominant == green:
        print("Most green!")
    else:
        print("Most blue!")

# 5. Write at least 3 function calles to color_dominance here


# 6. Write a function that returns a value, call that function, save the value in a variable, and print the value.
